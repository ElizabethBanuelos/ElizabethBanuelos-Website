        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Administration - MarketingðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">Born and raised in San Bernardino, CA, I am a University of California - Riverside Alumni who is currently searching for job opportunities to expand my skill set and experience in the Advertising and Marketing Field. My interest in this field began in highschool, when I first took a Graphic Design Class. I knew I loved to use my creativity and work digitally with colors and images. I also have many skills that make me fit for this position, including Creativity skills, Leadership Skills, Communication skills, and a strong ability to work in a team. I also have a strong work ethic and am responsible. I am a very creative person, and one of my career goals is to work in the Beauty Industry. This includes managing and creating advertising campaigns for beauty products and brands. I also enjoy the work environment and lifestyle of business related careers, so I think an Advertising/Marketing career is the perfect fit for me, because it aligns with my future goals and aspirations. I want to have a good work-life balance. 
<br><br>

        I count with a good academic standing both for highschool and college. In college I have undertaken a number of courses that have given me experience in all fields of Business. I have been in the top of my class since highschool and am very hardworking. I am a very goal-driven person who is very determined. Whenever I do anything or start a project, I am always independent and work until the very end. I am familiar with many technologies needed in a Business related position, like Excel, Word, and Canva. I am also bilingual and have received the California State of Biliteracy Seal. I am part of the American Marketing Association at UCR and have a lot of experience in working with other people. I have also completed various internships in the field and have a big expertise on related occupations. I enjoy working in Graphic Design and using my creativity to come up with new ideas.  
<br><br>

        Apart from being a student, I also enjoy taking long walks, traveling, and spending time with family. I am a strong believer that life is not just work. It is also enjoying it and spending time with friends and those whom you love most. I am a proud First Generation student, daughter of Mexican parents. I have also been a low-income student and am very grateful for the opportunities I have been given to create a better life for me and my family. I am proud of my roots and how far I have gotten in all areas of my life. I love learning new things and partaking in new opportunities. I am a person with strong morals and values. I believe success comes when you have true determination and willingness to succeed. If you believe it, you can do it. Although I have had many obstacles and hardships in my life, I have overcome them and became a better person both personally and professionally. I am proud of all of my achievements and accomplishments and hope to encounter new people and new opportunities.
